# START
# GET one integer from user
# GET another integer from user
# RETRIEVE the sum of both integers
# END

#2 a method that takes an array of strings, and 
# returns a string that is all those strings 
# concatenated together
# START
# Given an array of strings called "Strings"
# TAKE each string within the "Strings" array and combined together

#3 a method that takes an array of integers, 
# and returns a new array with every other element
# START
# Given an array of integers
# Given enpty array
# Assign each integer and index
# Go over the array and return the odd numbered integers and 
# push them into the blank array
# End

# arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# n_arr = []

# arr.each_with_index do |num, idx|
#   if idx % 2 == 0
#     n_arr << num
#   end
# end
